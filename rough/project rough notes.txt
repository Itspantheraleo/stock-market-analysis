A comprehensive Stock Market Analysis and Prediction web application with the following features:

- Data Collection: Fetch and store stock data from yfinance
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare stock data for analysis
- Data Visualization: Generate insightful charts (line, candlestick) using matplotlib or plotly
- Prediction: Implement machine learning models (Linear Regression, LSTM) for future stock price predictions
- User Interface: Provide a simple, integrated interface for users to interact with all modules

Technical Stack:
- Backend: Python with Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Libraries: yfinance, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib/plotly
- Database: PostgreSQL for data storage

UI/Style:
- Professional financial dashboard aesthetic with dark mode option
- Clean, minimalist design with emphasis on data presentation
- Intuitive controls for stock selection, date range, and prediction parameters

1. Fix Errors and Debugging
Solve the current error (KeyError: 'date') to ensure smooth execution.
Add proper error handling and logging for robustness.
2. Frontend Improvements
Add better UI/UX for the Flask app (e.g., input fields for multiple stocks, prediction results visualization).
Use libraries like Bootstrap or Materialize for a polished look.
3. Prediction Model Enhancements
Implement advanced prediction models like LSTM or ARIMA for time series analysis.
Add model evaluation metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE) for better insights.
4. Testing
Unit test each module (data fetching, visualization, prediction, etc.).
Perform integration testing to ensure modules work together seamlessly.
5. Deployment
Package the application for deployment on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
Use tools like Docker to containerize the app for consistency.
6. Documentation
Create a README file for the project.
Include setup instructions, features, and usage guidelines.
Add comments to your code for clarity.



Step 1: Error Handling and Debugging
Objective: Fix the 'date' KeyError and improve error handling.

Tasks:
Debug the plot_stock_data function to ensure the 'date' column is correctly fetched and processed.
Add error handling in the backend to log issues like missing columns or API failures.
Step 2: Frontend Enhancements
Objective: Improve user experience with a polished interface.

Tasks:
Design a form for users to enter stock tickers and date ranges.
Display predictions in an easy-to-read format (e.g., charts).
Add a section to compare multiple stocks.
Step 3: Prediction Model Enhancement
Objective: Use advanced models to improve accuracy.

Tasks:
Introduce LSTM (for deep learning-based predictions).
Add a feature for backtesting model predictions against historical data.
Create visual comparisons between actual vs. predicted prices.
Step 4: Deployment
Objective: Make your app available online for users.

Tasks:
Use Docker for containerization.
Deploy on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Implement HTTPS for secure access.
Step 5: Documentation
Objective: Add clear and concise documentation for future use.

Tasks:
Write a README.md file with:
Project Overview
Features
How to Run Locally
Add comments to all code files.
